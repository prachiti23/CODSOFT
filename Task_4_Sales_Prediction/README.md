# Task 4: Sales Prediction using Python  

## Objective  
Predict product sales based on features such as advertising spend and customer segmentation.  

##  Dataset  
- Source: [Sales Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input)  
- Features: Advertising budget, product category, customer type, etc.  
- Target: Sales  

##  Approach  
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor)  
4. Performance evaluation (RÂ², RMSE)  

##  Result  
- Built regression model that forecasts sales with good accuracy.
