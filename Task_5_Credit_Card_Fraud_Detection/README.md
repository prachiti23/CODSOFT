# Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection  

##  Objective  
Build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.  

##  Dataset  
- Source: [Credit Card Fraud Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- Highly imbalanced dataset (fraudulent vs genuine transactions).  

## Approach  
1. Preprocessing and normalization  
2. Handled imbalance using SMOTE/undersampling  
3. Applied classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
4. Evaluated models using Precision, Recall, F1-Score  

## Result  
- Achieved strong fraud detection performance, optimized for recall to minimize false negatives.
